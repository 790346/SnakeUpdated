There is only one mover present.
The orbiter orbits around the mover based on the angle of the direction between the center of the mover and the orbiter and the distance between the orbiter and the mover (amp).
Centripetal acceleration is added by increasing angVel, giving the orbiter a circular pattern relative to the mover.
